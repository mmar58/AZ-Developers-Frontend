# About

This is front end part of [AZ Developers](https://azdevelopers.unaux.com/). and this is free code and designed into reusable components. And also customized for rendering based on api data. So feel free to use the full code or any part of this and give us a like, if you liked it.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open <http://localhost:3000> with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses `next/font` to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
